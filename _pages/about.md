<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a researcher in the [MT Unit](https://mt.fbk.eu/) at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), Italy. 

My research interests mainly lie at the intersection of language, computation and society within the field of Natural Language Processing, and on the social and ethical implications of language technologies. I have primarily focused on cross-lingual and multilingual tasks such as machine translation, for both speech and text. 
I am also deeply interested in understanding how people use language technologies in their everyday lives, and how to best measure their impact on lay users with human-centered approaches.

In June 2023, I obtained my International Ph.D. (summa cum laude) from the University of Trento and Augsburg making contributions to the study of gender bias and inclusivty in speech and machine translation ([thesis](https://iris.unitn.it/retrieve/e7164ccd-934c-40ad-ae7b-c7a67ea1f32c/iris-PHD.pdf)). 

I am an organizer of the Workshop on [Gender-Inclusive Translation Technologies (GITT)](https://sites.google.com/view/gitt2026/home) and [Mind the AI-GAP: Co-Designing SocioTechnical Systems (AI-GAP)](https://aigap2025.isti.cnr.it/). I am also co-organizing the [Speech Instruction-Following](https://iwslt.org/2026/instruction-following) shared task at [IWSLT](https://iwslt.org/).

I am passionate about interdisciplinary work, activities and [dissemination](/talks/).
